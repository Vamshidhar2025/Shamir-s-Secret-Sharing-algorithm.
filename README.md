Secret Sharing
This project implements secret sharing schemes, including Shamir's Secret Sharing (SSS) and Verifiable Secret Sharing (VSS). The algorithms allow a secret to be divided into parts, where a certain number of parts are required to reconstruct the original secret.

Features
Shamir's Secret Sharing:

Divides a secret into multiple shares.
Any specified number of shares (threshold) can be used to reconstruct the secret.
Verifiable Secret Sharing:

Extends Shamir's scheme to allow verification of shares.
Ensures integrity and authenticity of the shares before reconstruction.
